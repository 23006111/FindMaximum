# Find the maximum of a list of numbers
## Aim:
To write a program to find the maximum of a list of numbers.
## Equipment’s required:
1.	Hardware – PCs
2.	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
1.	Get the list of marks as input
2.	Use the sort() function or max() function or use the for loop to find the maximum mark.
3.	Return the maximum value
## Program:
1.Program to mark the maximum of marks using the list method sort
```

'''
def max_marks(marks):
    marks.sort()
    return marks[-1]
```
2.Program to find the maximum marks using the list method max().
```

def max_marks(marks):
    a=max(marks)
    return a
``` 

## Output:
